* numfmt -- a spreadsheet number formatter
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: numfmt-a-spreadsheet-number-formatter
  :END:
The numfmt library formats numbers according to a specifier string as
defined in
[[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm][ECMA-376]].
The library tries its best to emulate the inns and outs of what the
Excel spreadsheet software does.

The library is written in pure JavaScript and has no dependencies. It is
comparable to the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssf][SSF]] with some
minor interface exceptions.

**** Features
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: features
     :END:
Why use this rather than the battle tested SSF? You may have no need to
but numfmt is fully open source, has equivalent (if not better)
formatting capabilities, built in international support,
customizability, and may run about twice as fast in most cases.

Adding locales is simple but those included are:

- Chinese (Simplified) (=zh-CN= or =zh=)
- Chinese (Traditional) (=zh-TW=)
- Czech (=cs=)
- Danish (=da=)
- Dutch (=nl=)
- English (=en=)
- Finnish (=fi=)
- French (=fr=)
- German (=de=)
- Greek (=el=)
- Hungarian (=hu=)
- Icelandic (=is=)
- Indonesian (=id=)
- Italian (=it=)
- Japanese (=ja=)
- Korean (=ko=)
- Norwegian Bokmål (=nb=)
- Polish (=pl=)
- Portuguese (=pt=)
- Russian (=ru=)
- Slovak (=sk=)
- Spanish (=es=)
- Swedish (=sv=)
- Thai (=th=)
- Turkish (=tr=)

The library is made to work with current generation spreadsheets and so
it does not support the
[[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/excel/1900-and-1904-date-system][1904
date system]]. It does not have built in tables for formats addressable
by offsets, you are expected to maintain those yourself.

** Installing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installing
   :END:
If you don't want to download and build numfmt yourself, the library is
conveniently provided as an NPM package:

#+begin_example
  $ npm install numfmt
#+end_example

** Using
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: using
   :END:
#+begin_src js
  import numfmt from "numfmt";

  // reusable function
  const formatter = numfmt("#,##0.00");
  const output = formatter(1234.56)
  console.log(output);

  // ... or just 
  const output = numfmt.format("#,##0.00", 1234.56);
  console.log(output);
#+end_src

** Format syntax

Microsoft have excellent
[[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/review-guidelines-for-customizing-a-number-format-c0a1d1fa-d3f4-4018-96b7-9c9354dd99f5][documentation
on how the format works]]. Here are some quick basics:

A format pattern is divided into 4 sections:
=<POSITIVE>;<NEGATIVE>;<ZERO>;<TEXT>=

Only the first section is mandatory, the others are filled in as needed.
The sections consist of symbols to indicate what to emit. The symbols
are case insensitive:

| Symbol                           | Result              | Description                                                                                                                                                         |

** API Reference
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: api-reference
   :END:
# *numfmt*(pattern[, options]])

Constructs a new /formatter/ function with the specified options.

Pattern must be a string according to the
[[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm][ECMA-376]]
number format. Options should be an object of options. You may change
defaults once for all instances using numfmt.options.

# /formatter/(value[, options])

Returns a formatted string for the argument value. If options object is
provided then it overrides the constructor options of those options
provided.

# /formatter/.isDate()

Returns a true or false depending on if the pattern is a date pattern.
The pattern is considered a date pattern if any of its sections contain
a date symbol (see table above). Each section is restricted to to be
/either/ a number or date format.

# /formatter/.isPercent()

Returns a true or false depending on if the pattern is a percentage
pattern. The pattern is considered a percentage pattern if any of its
sections contain a percentage symbol (see table above).

# /formatter/.isText()

Returns a true or false depending on if the pattern is a text percentage
pattern if its definition is composed of a single section that includes
that text symbol (see table above). For example =@= or =@" USD"= are
text patterns but =#;@= is not.

# /formatter/.color(value)

If the pattern defines colors this function will emit the color
appropriate to the value. If no colors were specified this function
returns ="black"=.

#+begin_src js
  import numfmt from "numfmt";

  const formatter = numfmt("[green]#,##0;[red]-#,##0");
  const color = formatter.color(-10)
  console.log(color); // "red"
#+end_src

# numfmt.*format*(pattern, value[, options])

Parses the format pattern and formats the value according to the
pattern, and optionally, any options. See definition [[#numfmt][above]].

# numfmt.*round*(number[, places])

Return a value rounded to the specified amount of places. This is the
rounding function used by the formatter (symmetric arithmetic rounding).

# numfmt.*parseLocale*(tag)

Parse a BCP 47 locale tag and emit an object of its parts. Intended for
internal use.

# numfmt.*getLocale*(tag)

Used by the formatter to pull a locate from its registered locales. If
subtag isn't available but the base language is, the base language is
used. So if =en-CA= is not found, the formatter tries to find =en= else
it returns a =null=.

# numfmt.*addLocale*(data, tag)

Register locale data for a language. The full data object looks like
this:

#+begin_src js
  {
    group: "\u00a0", // non-breaking space
    decimal: ".",
    positive: "+",
    negative: "-",
    percent: "%",
    exponent: "E",
    nan: "NaN",
    infinity: "∞",
    ampm: [ "AM", "PM" ],

    // gregorian calendar
    mmmm: [ "January", "February", … ],
    mmm: [ "Jan", "Feb", … ],
    dddd: [ "Sunday", "Monday", … ],
    ddd: [ "Sun", "Mon", … ]

    // islamic calendar
    mmmm6: [ "Muharram", "Safar", … ],
    mmm6: [ "Muh.", "Saf.", … ],
  }
#+end_src

The data object does not need to be complete, it will fall back to
defaults (mostly English) for any missing properties. Adding support for
Faroese you would require only passing the data different from the
defaults:

#+begin_src js
  numfmt.addLocale({
    group: ".",
    decimal: ",",
    mmmm: [ "januar", "februar", … ],
    mmm: [ "jan", "feb", … ],
    dddd: [ "sunnudagur", "mánadagur", … ],
    ddd: [ "sun", "mán", … ],
  }, "fo-FO");
#+end_src

If the language tag provided has a subtag and a base language does not
exit, the locale is register to both. In the Faroese example above both
=fo= and =fo-FO= will be created.

# numfmt.*isDate*(format)

Returns a true or false depending on if the pattern is a date pattern.
The pattern is considered a date pattern if any of its sections contain
a date symbol (see table above). Each section is restricted to to be
/either/ a number or date format.

For compatibility reasons, this function is also available as
=numfmt.is_date(format)=.

# numfmt.*isPercent*(format)

Returns a true or false depending on if the pattern is a percentage
pattern. The pattern is considered a percentage pattern if any of its
sections contain a percentage symbol (see table above).

# numfmt.*isText*(format)

Returns a true or false depending on if the pattern is a text percentage
pattern if its definition is composed of a single section that includes
that text symbol (see table above). For example =@= or =@" USD"= are
text patterns but =#;@= is not.

# numfmt.*options*(options)

Set a default option or options for the formatter. This will affect all
formatters unless they have overwritten options at construction time.
Calling =numfmt.options(null)= will reset to internal defaults.

#+begin_src js
  // basic "default" formatter
  const weekdayEN = numfmt("dddd");
  weekdayEN(1234); // "Monday"

  // setting a new default
  numfmt.options({ locale: "is" });

  // call the same formatter
  weekdayEN(1234); // "mánudagur"

  // construct a new formatter with a locale
  weekdayFR = numfmt("dddd", { locale: "fr", });
  weekdayFR(1234); // "lundi"

  // override settings at call-time
  weekdayEN(1234, { locale: "pl" }); // "poniedziałek"
  weekdayFR(1234, { locale: "pl" }); // "poniedziałek"
#+end_src

# The *options*

As well as allowing locale customization, numfmt behaviour can be
controlled with a
