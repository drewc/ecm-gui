#+TITLE: Messages: ECM is social media

Seriously, communication is what the entire IT industry is based on, and
messages, though they take many forms, are the basis for a lot of management.

* TODO ~.msg~ files: on Exchange, Outlook is good

... for the rest of the world, outlook not so good. Since we've yet to develop
our own ~.msg~ reader in Gerbil (soon to come!), and the file format is not
quite simple[fn:msgff], we'll use an NPM package[fn:msgreader]. 

#+begin_src shell
yarn add @kenjiuno/msgreader
#+end_src

Now in ~ecm.js~ We'll import and export it so that ~this.$ecm.MsgReader~
resolves to it.
