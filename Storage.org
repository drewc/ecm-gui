#+TITLE: Storage: DB in the client

I don't want to have to keep typing the same things in search over and over
again when I only access a tiny bit of the 60,000+ claims.

There are likely a bunch of other things that should be cached so here we go.

https://localforage.github.io/localForage/ is a good start.

Here's the docs: [[file:doc/localforage.org::#localforage][localForage]]
#+begin_src js :tangle ./src/assets/storage.js
import localforage from 'localforage'

localforage.config({
  name: 'ECM GUI',
  storageName: 'ecmgui'
});

export const cache = localforage;

export default { localforage }


#+end_src
